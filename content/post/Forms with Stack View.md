<p>My original form setup was static; all the fields were pinned.  If data was not present for the item the label would still display on the main page, making for poor readability.</p>

<br />
<p>Using a stack view instead of pinning each textfield allowed me to create a reusable screen that dynamically shows and hides fields depending on if the item has corresponding information. When the user edits the item all fields are visible, when they are done editing only fields with information are displayed. This tutorial was great in showing how to create a dynamic form using a stack view.</p>
