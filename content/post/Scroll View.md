<p> Getting the scrollview to work for me took multiple attempts.  I finally was able to get it working be creating a new <a href="https://github.com/katiewhelan/IOSProjectWork/tree/Master/ScrollArea/ScrollArea">project</a> and working through this tutorial step by step.  I then when back to my main project and implemented the same steps.</p>

<p> Here is a link to the <a href="https://fluffy.es/scrollview-storyboard-xcode-11/">ScrollView</a> tutorial. This was the step that was different from other tutorials.</p>
