<p>Since I used firebase for a few of the course tutorials I decided I would stick with it for my app.  I wanted to be able to store a decent amount of data, but not on my phone.  This was the main reason for not going with core data for my application.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li class="addHeight">Good documentation/Easy to set up</li>
<li class="addHeight">Quickly integrated with IOS project</li>
<li class="addHeight">Able to create a node script to upload data from a CSV</li>

</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li class="addHeight">Need 3rd party, like Algolia, for better searching capacity</li>
<li class="addHeight">Can only search from start of string</li>
<li class="addHeight">Only access data when service is available</li>
</ul>
