<p>Through the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/">Udemy</a> tutorial I was able to try out SwiftUI. Check out the examples here <a href="https://github.com/katiewhelan/IOSProjectWork/tree/Master/SwiftUI">Github</a>. </p>

<p>The tricky part was getting the image sized correctly, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56505692/how-to-resize-image-with-swiftui">stackoverflow</a>
 article has a great example on sizing (screenshot below). By setting the frame width and height and than giving an offset for the photo I was able to fill the frame and center the image.</p>
