<p>When an image is not available for an item, or a user would like to add a custom image, they can take a photo from their phone.  The image will be uploaded to Firebase storage for retrieval the next time the item is pulled up.</p>
<br />
<div class="container space-around">
  <img src="/images/swift/collect/Camera2.PNG" class="gifImage"/>
  <img src="/images/swift/collect/Camera3.PNG" class="gifImage"/>
  <img src="/images/swift/collect/Camera4.PNG" class="gifImage"/>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The setup to use the camera was quick and straight forward, storing the images in Firebase storage was straight forward as well.  Here is an example on <a href="https://github.com/katiewhelan/IOSProjectWork/tree/Master/takingPictures">Github</a> or these tutorials walk through the setup step by step. </p>
