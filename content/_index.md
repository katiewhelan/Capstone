This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backward compatible with initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

I am currently completing the [MSSE Program](https://cse.umn.edu/msse) at the University of Minnesota.  As part of my final semester I am completing an independent study in mobile development.

Why Switch To Mobile
+ way of the future
+ how much often phones are Used
+ want to have input in user interaction/design
