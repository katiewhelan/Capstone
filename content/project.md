# Independent Study
*****

##### Part 1 - Learning Kotlin & Swift
To get exposure to Kotlin and Swift I completed two different tutorials through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).  Each course started with the basic and progressed to creating several small applications.

##### Part 2 - Creating an IOS App
After completing the courses in Kotlin and Swift I developed my own app that allows the user to track collections of objects. I have used different apps like IMDB or GoodReads to track movies and books but wanted a singular location where I could access and track multiple types of data.
